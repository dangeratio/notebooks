# notebooks
a notebook of todo lists using cakephp, XAMPP, jquery, and tinymce

Installation

    Get a recent version of CakePHP. (http://cakephp.org/) I used CakePHP 2.6.1
    Get a recent version of XAMPP.  (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) I used XAMPP 5.6.3-0 for Mac
    Build an initial cakephp project, setup SQL connections etc.
    Run the cakeTodo.sql on your sql database to create the required tables
    Copy notebooks files into the directory of your cakephp project
    You may also need to make ./app/tmp directory editable

Features

    View a set of Notebooks (essentially a simplified version of onenote)
    Each notebook has a set of notes
    Notes have a title and body, body is WYSIWYG editable using tinymce (see screenshot below)

Future Updates

    Ability to Search all notebooks (similar to MS Onenote)
    Ability to add Images to notes
